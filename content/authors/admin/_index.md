Jimmy Bernot (he/him) is an evolutionary biologist and NSF Postdoc Research Fellow at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. His research interests include crustacean phylogenetics, copepod taxonomy and systematics, parasite evolution, and computational biology. He is working to resolve the crustacean tree of life and understand the processes that have resulted in the spectacular morphological diversity of modern crustaceans, with a particular focus on parasitic copepods.

He is also passionate about science communication, public engagement, education, and outreach. Jimmy regularly participates in outreach events in Washington DC, especially at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History and surrounding K-12 schools. He is actively involved in science engagement on digital media platforms including [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JimmyBernot), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jimmybernot/), [Skype A Scientist](https://www.skypeascientist.com), and podcasts.
